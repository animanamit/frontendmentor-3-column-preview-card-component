## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although it may not be the same in other situations here's how I managed to center things in this project.

```css
.how-to-center-in-middle-of-screen {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

```css
.how-to-center-button-div-text {
  height: 40px;
  line-height: 40px;
}
```

### Continued development

I struggled with a number of common things in this project like centering this in the middle of the screen or in the middle of the div so I'd like to keep practicing so I know how to do that quickly and efficiently in every situation.

I would also like to focus on how I can make my CSS more concise and less clumsy because I think restructuring the HTML would allow me to reduce some lines of styling.
